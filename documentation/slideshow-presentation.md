# Mission

# Mission

* one-stop-shop for staff looking for research statistics

* general information at a glance

* powerful enough for interested staff to dig in and find
    insights that would ordinarily be hidden or impossible to
    discern

-------------------------------------------------------------

# How can I see it

# How can I see it

* the dashboard lives on a NYPL controlled domain and is available
    here: https://nypldigital.shinyapps.io/research-dashboard/

-------------------------------------------------------------

# Why

# Why

* number of limitations/obstacles with current statistics
    gathering / review process

* codify knowledge and idiosyncracies

* version control
  * https://github.com/NYPL/sierra-shadow-dataset

* error checking

* apparatus joins disparate data sources

* powered by a data substrate which is useful independent of
  the dashboard

-------------------------------------------------------------

# Demo

-------------------------------------------------------------

# Future

  * More helpful options for curators
    * limit languages
    * limit subjects

  * listen
    * un-anticipated needs

  * projection of Old Billings taxonomy onto LC Subject
    controlled vocabulary

  * consider authentication
